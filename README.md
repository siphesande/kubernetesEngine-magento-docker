Deploy Magento 2 using Kubernetes Engine

Start Magento 2 with Google Cloud Platform Kubernetes Engine

NOTE: THIS IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS

- By now, you have installed kubectl: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/
- If you are using Google Cloud, make sure that you have done these:
  1. Installed Google Cloud SDK
  2. Created a Project
  3. Created a cluster
  ```- $ gcloud container clusters create cluster_name
     - $ gcloud config set container/cluster cluster_name
  ```

  4. Connect to the cluster -
  ``` $ gcloud container clusters get-credentials cluster_name --zone us-central1-a --project project_name
      $ kubectl proxy
      You will get this: Starting to serve on 127.0.0.1:8001 (leave it open and work on the other terminal tap to avoid    terminating the process)
      Open the Dashboard interface > http://localhost:8001/ui```
  5.Create your persistent disks - $ gcloud compute disks create --size 200GB mysql-disk
                                 - $ gcloud compute disks create --size 200GB magento2-disk
```                                                                
MySQL deployment to Kubernetes and Set up

First step to deploy MySQL is to create a Kubernetes Secret to store the password for the database. To create a Secret named mysql, run the following command (and replace YOUR_PASSWORD with a passphrase of your choice):
```
$ kubectl create secret generic mysql --from-literal=password=YOUR_PASSWORD
```
```
Deploy MySql
```
$ kubectl create -f mysql.yaml
```
Create MySQL service
The next step is to create a Service to expose the MySQL container and make it accessible from the magento2 container you are going to create.
```
$ kubectl create -f mysql-service.yaml
```

Magento 2 Set up and deployment to Kubernetes
```
$ kubectl create -f magento2.yaml
```
To expose your Magento2 application to traffic from the internet using a load balancer, you need a Service with type:LoadBalancer
```
$ kubectl create -f magento2-service.yaml
```
Once the service is created, we can get the externally accessible IP address by listing all the services:
```
$ kubectl get services
```

From this, you can now access your application by visiting the External IP address on port 80
```
http://104_________:80/

```
```
Cleaning up
 $ kubectl delete secret  mysql
    $ kubectl delete deployment -l app=magento2
    $ kubectl delete service -l app=magento2
    (Do the same for mysql and phpmyadmin)
    - You can also delete using kubernetes ui(Dashboard)

    If use Google cloud do this:
     $ gcloud compute disks delete mysql-disk magento2-disk
     Delete the cluster, which deletes the resources used by the cluster, including virtual machines, disks, and network resources.
     $ gcloud container clusters delete cluster_name
     Alternately, you can delete the project in its entirety. To do so using the gcloud tool, run:
     $ gcloud projects delete ${PROJECT_ID}
